# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the pipeline builder UI to make it production-ready with a top-notch user experience. The current implementation has several issues including poor visual design, non-functional buttons, confusing navigation, and an overly complex interface. This improvement will streamline the UI, ensure all functionality works correctly, and create an intuitive pipeline building experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and intuitive pipeline builder interface, so that I can easily create and manage CI/CD pipelines without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the pipeline builder THEN I SHALL see a simplified, modern interface with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN I interact with any button or control THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and perform its intended function
3. WHEN I build a pipeline THEN the interface SHALL guide me through the process with clear visual cues and helpful tooltips
4. WHEN I use the component palette THEN it SHALL be organized logically with search and filtering capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all buttons and controls to be functional, so that I can complete my pipeline building tasks without encountering broken features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click any button in the pipeline builder THEN it SHALL perform its documented function without errors
2. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN they SHALL work consistently across the interface
3. WHEN I interact with node controls THEN they SHALL provide appropriate actions (edit, delete, configure)
4. WHEN I save or export a pipeline THEN the action SHALL complete successfully with user feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing between dashboard and pipeline builder to work correctly, so that I can navigate seamlessly between different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Create Pipeline" from the dashboard THEN I SHALL be navigated to /pipelines/builder
2. WHEN I complete pipeline creation THEN I SHALL be redirected to /pipelines with the new pipeline visible
3. WHEN I use browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly without breaking the application state
4. WHEN I bookmark the pipeline builder URL THEN I SHALL be able to access it directly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined component palette, so that I can quickly find and add the pipeline components I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the component palette THEN I SHALL see components organized in logical categories with clear icons
2. WHEN I search for components THEN the results SHALL be filtered in real-time
3. WHEN I drag components to the canvas THEN they SHALL snap into place with visual feedback
4. WHEN I hover over components THEN I SHALL see helpful descriptions and usage hints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive visual feedback throughout the pipeline builder, so that I understand the current state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any action THEN I SHALL receive immediate visual feedback (loading states, success/error messages)
2. WHEN I select nodes or edges THEN they SHALL be clearly highlighted with available actions visible
3. WHEN I connect pipeline steps THEN the connections SHALL be visually clear with proper flow indicators
4. WHEN I make changes THEN the interface SHALL indicate unsaved changes and provide save options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline builder to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I can work efficiently without encountering errors or broken states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent them and show helpful error messages
2. WHEN I delete connected nodes THEN the system SHALL handle edge cleanup automatically
3. WHEN I have unsaved changes and try to navigate away THEN I SHALL be prompted to save or discard changes
4. WHEN the interface encounters errors THEN it SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery options
