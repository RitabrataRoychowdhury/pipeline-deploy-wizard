Frontend Routes (App Router)

Root and Landing
- /            -> Redirects to /dashboard (actual app)
- /lander      -> Public landing page with links to App and Demo
- /welcome     -> Public welcome page

Demo Mode (JSON-backed; no network calls)
- /demo                -> Demo Dashboard
- /demo/dashboard      -> Demo Dashboard
- /demo/pipelines      -> Demo Pipelines list
- /demo/pipelines/builder -> Demo Visual Pipeline Builder

Authenticated App (requires login)
- /dashboard           -> Main Dashboard (protected)
- /pipelines           -> Pipelines list (protected)
- /pipelines/builder   -> Visual Pipeline Builder (protected)
- /repositories        -> Repositories (protected)
- /settings            -> Settings (protected)
- /animations          -> Animations demo (protected)

Fallback
- *            -> NotFound page for all unmatched routes

Notes
- Unauthenticated users navigating to protected routes are redirected to /lander.
- Demo routes use local JSON data under src/data/demo and never call the backend.
